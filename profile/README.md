RIIZE secured the Rookie Award through fan votes. Since their debut in September 2023 with "Get A Guitar," RIIZE has quickly become a monster rookie, achieving million-seller status with both their debut single album and their first mini-album 'RIIZING'.

UNIS was awarded the IS Rookie Award. The girl group has shown impressive growth since their debut in March, achieving the eighth-highest first-week sales for a debut album among girl groups with 'WE UNIS'. Their recent single album 'CURIOUS' topped iTunes charts in five countries and demonstrated further growth in sales.

Lee Chan Won won two awards: Best Adult Contemporary and Trot Star of the Year.

His recent achievement of winning 'Music Bank' with "A Travel to the Sky" marked the first time in 17 years for a trot singer.

Stray Kids, Seventeen, Lim Young Woong, and NCT Dream were among the winners of the Best Song 10 award. Other awards were given to xikers for the Photogenic Award, BTS's V for K-Pop Solo Artist of the Year, and Park Ji Hyun for Trot Rookie of the Year.
